Workers show a clear acceleration of mortality whereas queens die very rapidly after their sperm stocks are exhausted, often assassinated by the workers.

Herein, they are classified as <i>Canis familiaris</i> for practical reasons. Dogs could prove an ideal model to study ageing as they share many of the same illnesses, medical treatments and environments that humans do. Additionally they have a well annotated genome and can be studied in their natural environment [1208]. +p There is considerable variation in life history among the different dog breeds, including differences in longevity. In general, smaller breeds of dogs tend to live longer and may age slower [0423], though some have argued this might be due to artificial selection for high growth rates [0726]. One study in England reported the longest-lived pure breeds were Miniature poodle, Bearded collie, Border collie and Miniature dachshund. The shortest-lived were the Dogue de Bordeaux and Great Dane. Longevity in crossbred dogs exceeded purebred dogs by 1.2 years [1141]. +p Dogs are considered old after they are about 12 years old, though a few can live over 20 years [0434]. There are anecdotal reports of dogs living around 30 years, including one Australian cattle dog named ""Bluey"" living 29.5 years. These records are unverified and the maximum longevity of dogs is currently 24 years (J. Veronica Kiklevich, pers. comm.). A Shiba Inu mix breed male called ""Pusuke"" was reportedly 26.7 years of age when it died, which is unconfirmed but plausible. +p Older dogs are affected by a variety of degenerative conditions and age-related diseases that are also observed in humans; larger breeds are often affected by conditions that may be related to their rapid growth, such as cancer; smaller breeds can also suffer from cancer as well as from cardiac disease. Hearing loss, cataracts and senile dementia have also been observed [0981]. Neoplastic, musculoskeletal and neurological disorders have been found to be the most frequently attributed causes of death [1141].

Although women tend to outlive men and there are gender differences in age-related pathologies, overall there are probably no differences between the sexes in terms of rate of ageing. Likewise, populations in different environments do not appear to greatly differ in rate of ageing even though they can differ on specific age-related diseases. The human mortality rate begin to increase exponentially after about age 30, doubling roughly every 8 years. The body's functional decline, however, starts after the sexual peak, roughly at age 19, and perhaps some functions decline even earlier in life [0014]. A peculiar phenomena, though not unique of humans, is that the MRDT increases after about age 65. This has been suggested to be a statistical effect rather than any unknown biological process [0031]. Numerous physiological, endocrine, cellular and molecular changes have been observed with age in humans [0975]. Cardiovascular diseases are the major cause of death in modern societies, followed by several types of cancer; the increase in lifespan is also leading to an increase in the incidence of neurodegenerative conditions such as Alzheimer's disease [0981].+p French woman Jeanne Calment is recorded as the longest-lived human being and was over 122 years of age when she died in 1997 [0029]. Compared to other species, of course, the maximum longevity of humans is based on a considerably larger sample. Therefore, it has been argued that, for comparative purposes, it is more adequate to use as human maximum longevity 90 or 100 years [0715].+p The average human life expectancy worldwide is 66 years, ranging from 39 years in Zambia to 82 years in Japan. Among hunter-gatherers, the average life expectancy was probably around 30 years [0841]."

2426,0.04,8,59.4,large,acceptable,captivity,671,"Physiological observations indicate that chimpanzees develop age-related changes typical of humans at considerably earlier ages, and geriatric chimpanzees were originally defined as animals with 34 years of age and older [0590]. Even in captivity, young adult chimpanzees have considerably higher mortality rates than humans [0008]. Therefore, while it is not known whether the pace of ageing is different between chimpanzees and humans, the onset of ageing appears to occur at earlier ages in chimpanzees. The MRTD and IMR were estimated based on mortality rates obtained from field sites [0834]. The difference in longevity does not appear to be related to telomere shortening. Telomere attrition rates are similar between the two species and telomeres are twice as long in chimpanzees than in humans [1172]. Additionally, unlike humans, chimpanzees exhibit few age-related changes in total brain and grey matter volume, cortical thickness, and mean depth and folding of major cortical sulci [1173]. +p Determining the maximum longevity of chimpanzees is problematic due to the many anecdotal reports. ""Cheeta"", a male chimpanzee who participated in some Tarzan movies, has been reported to still be alive [0505], and having died at 80 years of age [0853]; these claims have not been verified and may well be exaggerated. One wild-born female called ""Little Mama"" was estimated to be over 70 years of age at Lion Country Safari in Florida [0842]. Another specimen, called ""Gregoire"", reportedly died at the age of 66 in Congo after living most of his life in Brazzaville Zoo. In spite of these claims, chimpanzees in captivity have not been confirmed to live for more than 60 years [0671]. Therefore, although the issue is controversial, the established maximum longevity of chimpanzees remains the 59.4 years that a female called ""Gamma"" was when she died in 1992 at Yerkes Regional Primate Research Center in Atlanta [0574]. Similarly, the maximum longevity in the wild belongs to one 55 year-old female, though there are unverified reports suggesting a longer lifespan [0008]. +p There is considerable controversy regarding whether chimpanzees reach menopause [0976]. A 56 year-old female has been reported to give birth at Sunset Zoo in Manhattan, Kansas [0854]. Menopause coincides with the end of lifespan in many nonhuman primates. Changes in the reproductive tracts of aged chimpanzees mimic changes described in the reproductive tracts of aged humans, apart from malignant changes in the mammary gland and prostate gland [1233]."

The INK4 locus of naked mole rats encodes a functional p15/p16 hybrid isoform (in addition to the other products) which is expressed in response to a number of cancer related stresses. In cultured cells this hybrid product has a stronger ability to induce cell-cycle arrest than either p15 or p16 and may contribute to the increased cancer resistance of this species [1176]. +p Record longevity belongs to one specimen caught in the wild in 1980 that lived over 30 years in captivity until it died in 2010, making it at least 31 years of age when it died (Rochelle Buffenstein, pers. comm.).

In addition to their cancer resistance naked mole-rats appear to have natural protection against amyloid beta plaque formation, a process implicated in Alzheimer's disease (AD). In one study, the brains of the longest lived naked mole-rats contained similar levels of amyloid beta to mouse models of AD yet showed no evidence of extracellular plaque formation [1178]. Even young naked mole-rats have high levels of soluble amyloid beta in their brains, linked to lower levels of UPS-mediated amyloid beta degradation [1179]. Another study found that levels of phosphorylated tau protein, also implicated in AD, were higher in naked mole-rats than mouse models. Despite this, the phosphorylated tau protein maintained normal axonal localisation [1180].  This suggests naked mole-rats also have a resistance to neurodegenerative disease."

The same study reported a decrease in reproductive output which could be due to the fact animals were kept in captivity.

In addition, the level of oxidatively damaged proteins in the heart does not change significantly up to 120 years of age [1162]. +p The ocean quahog clam has very high proteome stability, especially in comparison to short-lived mammals. In one study it was demonstrated these animals had no increase in global proteome unfolding in response to several stressors [1163]. The extreme maximum lifespan of the ocean quahog clam appears to be independent of telomere dynamics. Telomere lengths show no change with age, with no significant differences between populations and tissues. Telomerase activity is also highly heterogenous and does not correlate with age or population habitat [1164]. A study that measured four age-related damage markers (protein oxidation, lipid oxidation, nucleic acid oxidation, and protein stability) reported that only nucleic acid oxidation accumulates with age in these animals [1165].

Although physiological ageing has been described in roundworms, in particular at the level of decreased movement which may reflect a decline in muscle cells, the cause of death of old animals remains a mystery [0981].+p Several genetic manipulations have succeeded in extending the longevity of the roundworm, but many of these take into account the dauer stage, which involves a developmental arrest [0592].

Although there are anecdotal claims of organisms living over 10,000 years, the oldest plant is probably the bristlecone pine (<i>Pinus longaeva</i>) that has been estimated to be able to live over 4,000 years and avoid ageing [0501].In trees mass growth rate increases continuously with tree size. Old trees act as senescent carbon reservoirs and actively fix large amounts of carbon compared to smaller trees [1288]. Species with vegetative reproductive may live even longer.

It is also possible to measure chronological lifespan in yeast in terms of stationary phase survival; that is, the survival of individual cells in a non-dividing state. Longevity varies considerably between strains and various manipulations, including caloric restriction which in yeast consists of reducing the glucose level, increase lifespan [0981]. Caloric restriction replicative lifespan extension in yeast has been reported to be a non-cell autonomous process. Conditioned medium from caloric restriction treated cells transmits the longevity benefit of caloric restriction to moved mother cells, suggesting the process may benefit neighbouring cells, not only the individual cell [1209]. +p Several genes have been identified that regulate clonal senescence or chronological lifespan [0056], but because these two measurements are fundamentally different some genes have been shown to have opposite effects on them [0746]."
