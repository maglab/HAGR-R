49,3,mammal,1q21,154962298,154974483,-1,"    SHC1 encodes three splice variants: p46, p52, and p66. In an initial longevity study, mice double-mutants for p66 were shown to live 30% longer though it is not clear whether they age slower [6]. Additionally, the p66 mutants display an increased cognitive performance, lower emotionality and a higher pain threshold, in addition to increased basal levels of BDNF in the hippocampus, as well as decreased levels of oxidative stress markers [3626]. However, in a second study the longevity extension could not be replicated and the authors found that the knockout of Shc1 does not increase median or maximum lifespan in mice [3547]. Although the exact functions of SHC1 remain unknown, it appears to play a role in the regulation of intra-cellular redox levels, signal transduction, and apoptosis [7]. p66 mutant mice have been shown to have reduced oxidative stress and mitochondrial apoptosis. In |TERC| knockout mice, which normally show accelerated aging, inactivation of p66 rescues sterility and weight loss, as well as organ atrophy. However, there is no impact on shortened lifespan or telomere erosion [4354]. p66/SHC1 depletion in mice stimulates brown fat (a key thermogenic tissue) activity, resulting in a higher insulin-dependent glucose uptake and a higher energy expenditure. Additionally, brown adipose tissue cells exhibit increased mitochondrial respiration, increased expression of several mitochondrial and lipid-oxidative enzymes, which may be the cause for the improved metabolism of SHC1-deficient mice [3625]. Studies in humans have so far failed to associate polymorphisms in the SHC1 gene with ageing or longevity [231]. "

Cells from Hutchinson-Gilford's progeroid syndrome patients are characterised by accumulation of abnormally shaped nuclei, accumulation of DNA damage and premature senescence [4328]. LMNA mutations (such as the G608G mutation) generate more accessible splicing donor sites and lead to the production of an alternatively spliced product of LMNA called progerin, normally found in ageing cells.

GH1 levels decline with age in humans and may contribute to loss of body mass [280]. Several results from model organisms, including rodents, suggest that the GH1/|IGF1| axis plays a role in ageing. However, it is the attenuation of GH1/|IGF1| activity that is associated with longevity in model organisms [286]. Transgenic mice overexpressing bovine GH1 are bigger than controls and may age faster [278]. Ames mice, which lack GH1 due to a mutation in | PROP1|, have increased health span and lifespan. Ames mice fed on a high fat diet are obese yet more insulin (|INS|) sensitive than control mice [4355]. Ames mice have been crossbred with mice lacking |GHR|, producing a new lineage lacking both GH1 and the GH receptor. These mice have improved glucose tolerance and increased adiponectin levels. Whilst these mice show the same increased longevity as their progenitors they do not show any further increases in longevity [4374]. In rats, moderate suppression of GH1 slightly extends lifespan while an extreme suppression leads to a shorter lifespan [287]. \n\n   +p Growth hormone deficiency has been thought to diminish lifespan in humans [144]. However, it has been shown that GH1 secretion is diminished and tightly controlled in humans with familial longevity. Middle aged offspring of long living families were sampled, along with their partners as controls. No significant differences were observed in circulating levels of |IFG1| and |IGFBP3| [4362]. Despite its controversy, GH1 is a possible candidate for a gene playing a role in human ageing. \n"
