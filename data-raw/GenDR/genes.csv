Two protein products of this gene are predicted to contain a glutamine/asparagine (Q/N)-rich ('prion') domain, by the algorithm of Michelitsch and Weissman (as of the WS77 release of WormBase, i.e., in wormpep77). Proteins bearing such domains can sometimes stably exist in at least two distinct physical states, each associated with a different phenotype; propagation of one of these traits is achieved by a self-perpetuating change in the protein from one form to the other, mediated by conformational changes in the glutamine/asparagine-rich domain. Prion domains are both modular and transferable to other proteins, on which they can confer a heritable epigenetic alteration of function; existing bioinformatics data indicate that they are rare in non-eukarya, but common in eukarya. Therefore, it is possible that this gene's protein product undergoes epigenetic control of protein activity, through heritable epigenetic modulation of protein function by self-perpetuating conformational conversions of normal proteins in healthy cells.

","Methionine restriction (a form of dietary restriction) enhances lifespan in various organisms including mammals. GH-deficient Ames dwarfs, mice that have a mutation in the Prop-1 gene, live longer than wild-type mice when their diet contains 0.43% or 1.3% methionine. Contrastly, there is no significant difference in lifespan on a diet of 0.16% methionine, wild-type mice being  under these conditions long-lived as well. This suggests that lifespan extension by methionine restriction might work through similar mechanisms as those confering Ames mice greater lifespan.
