Dual SOD1 + CCS1 overexpression elevated the levels of Cu,Zn-Sod activity six- to eight-fold in vegetative cultures. It also increased the optimized survival of stationary cells up to two-fold, showing this chronological lifespan is ultimately limited by oxidative stress. In contrast, several detrimental effects resulted when the SOD1 gene was overexpressed in the absence of either high copper or a simultaneous overexpression of CCS1. Both the chronological and the replicative lifespans were shortened; the cells displayed an abnormally high level of endogenous oxidative stress, resulting in a high rate of spontaneous mutation.
